# what are models?

__"in the context of machine-learning, what is a 'model'?"__

In machine learning, a model is a mathematical representation or algorithm that learns patterns in data and can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. A model is trained on a dataset and learns to recognize relationships and patterns in the data, which it can then use to make predictions or decisions about new data points. The goal of a model is to accurately generalize to new, unseen data, based on what it has learned from the training data.

In machine learning, a model is like a recipe that learns patterns from data. Just like you can use a recipe to make a cake, a model can make predictions or decisions based on what it has learned from the data it was trained on. The goal is for the model to be able to make accurate predictions or decisions on new data it hasn't seen before, just like how a good recipe can help you make a tasty cake every time.

__"does machine learning use models, or does it create models?"__

In machine learning, models are created through a process called model training. During this process, an algorithm is fed with a set of labeled data called a training dataset. The algorithm then iteratively adjusts its parameters to learn patterns and relationships in the data, with the goal of minimizing a specified error metric. Once the training process is complete, the resulting model can be used to make predictions or classify new data.

So to answer your question, machine learning algorithms create models through a process of training them on data. However, before training, the initial architecture of the model needs to be defined, such as the number of layers and the number of nodes in each layer. This architecture is typically designed by human experts, although there are also automated approaches that can help optimize the model architecture. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. (ChatGPT, 2023-Feb-25)
